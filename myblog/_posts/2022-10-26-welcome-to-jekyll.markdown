Hello! My name is Egg, and I am a 4th year student studying B.Sc. Computer Science
at University of Strathclyde. This marks the beginning of my 4th Years Honours Project
where I implement my very own static site generator.

I am currently trying to learn Jekyll so that I know what is to be expected when I create my own generator.
So, this blog is essentially for me to gain a better understanding of how Jekyll works.

## Installing Ruby and Jekyll
The initial installation and set up was fairly straightforward. You download Ruby installer and run cmd to
double-check the version (**ruby -v**) and in cmd, install Jekyll with **gem install jekyll bundler**.
It's as straightforward as this gets.



- It's quite straightforward.
- The base template/layout is clean and simple.
- I could do more with the website, but I will keep it minimalistic.
- Part of the project is for me to explore the features of Jekyll and decide what I like and not like about this generator.
