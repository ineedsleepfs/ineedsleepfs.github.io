I decided to travel to Japan and I do not regret it one bit! The culture the environment
it's so much nicer than where I am from - oops, sorry my hometown.

Anyway, now that I am back from Japan, I'd like to show everyone some photos I have taken during my trip there.
I hope everyone likes them! Oh, and please enjoy!

the structure of the buildings the roads they all looked so clean and nice.

While walking along the streets of Japan, it gave off such a nice calm peaceful vibe.</p>
